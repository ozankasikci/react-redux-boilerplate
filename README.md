# react-redux-boilerplate
## Why?

Because every time i want to start a new react project, i start to look for a nice boilerplate.

Because setting up webpack and the build stream is harder than it needs to be.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ozankasikci/react-redux-boilerplate.git
npm i
npm start
```
